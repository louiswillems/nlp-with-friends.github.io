## When do we meet?
Every week or two on Wednesdays for one hour. The speakers select one of three times: [12:00 am UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20200805T000000&p1=224&p2=179&p3=136&p4=676&p5=33&p6=152){:target="_blank"}, [8:00 am UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20200805T080000&p1=224&p2=179&p3=136&p4=676&p5=33&p6=152){:target="_blank"} and [14:00 am UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20200805T140000&p1=224&p2=179&p3=136&p4=676&p5=33&p6=152){:target="_blank"}, to allow people from different places to be able to join and engage the discussion. Click on each time to see time zone conversions to your area (and note the possible dateline change -- for some time zones, it may be Tuesday!). 

## Where do we meet?
On Zoom! In order to avoid [zoom-bombing](/assets/images/zoom-bomb.png), we will send the zoom-invite through email.
We ask that all participants register for talks through eventbrite, and will receive the zoom link in the confirmation email(s). 
Eventbrite registration links are listed in both the [talk descriptions](/upcoming) and their [calendar events](/calendar). 

## What does a talk look like? 
Every talk will take place over one hour, though each speaker will decide how to balance talk and discussion during this time. Additional questions may be asked following the seminar for a brief period via the Disqus Q&A on the individual talk’s page, though the comments will be later disabled to allow the speaker to conclude their talk.

## Who’s speaking next?
Check out our [upcoming speakers list](/upcoming)!

## Are the seminars recorded?
Yes! But just the talks themselves (and any questions asked *during* the presentation) will be recorded.
The discussions following talks will not be recorded, in order to encourage discussion and remove hesitations about question-asking. 
Recorded talks can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0zsOCvKa2iEqmPV6WGhjuP-tsrUy102C){:target="_blank"}.<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>  Or, check out the [Past](/past) section to watch a specific talk.

<a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: Recordings of talks that contain content that is under anonymity periods will be released once the anonymity period concludes.

## Is there a code of conduct? How will zoom-bombing or other misbehavior be handled? 
Yes! See our [community guidelines](/guidelines/#community-guidelines).
